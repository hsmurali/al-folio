 I am Harihara Subrahmaniam Muralidharan, a 3<sup>rd</sup> year graduate student advised by [Prof. Mihai Pop](https://pop-lab.org){:target="_blank"} with the [department of computer science](https://cs.umd.edu){:target="_blank"} at the University of Maryland. I work in bioinfiormatics and computational biology with a focus in  computational genomics and metagenomics. 

 Prior to graduate school I spent 3 wonderful years at the TCS innovation labs at Chennai, India working on analytics for cyberphysical systems. I worked on building models for analyzing complex HVAC-R systems such as chillers and, buildings from their data foot prints. I had an opportunity to be mentored by Dr. Arunchandar Vasan, Dr. Venkatesh Sarangan and Dr. Srinarayana. 

I was a research intern at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Barcelona between Feb '15 and Jun '15 as a part of the Semester Abraod Programme(SAP) at SASTRA University. At UPC I worked with Prof. Tomàs Aluja Banet at the [inLab](https://inlab.fib.upc.edu/en){:target="_blank"} working on learning analytics.
